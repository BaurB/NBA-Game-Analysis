# NBA-Game-Analysis
NBA game play-by-play data between Warriors and Thunder on 16th October 2018 was recorded and analysed. Players stats have been counted and presented in the table format. I have used two functions:
* analyse_nba_game(play_by_play_moves) which receives an array of play and returns a dictionary summary of the game.
* print_nba_game_stats(team_dict) which prints players data in the tabular format.

play-by-play data has also been included in the repository under the mynba.txt name

Output: Warriors Players Stats after the game.
